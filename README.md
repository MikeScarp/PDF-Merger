PDF Merger
=============

A simple script for combining PDF files into one larger PDF file, with bookmarks
to allow for easy navigation of the resulting files.  Currently takes all PDFs
in the current directory and combines them in natural sort order, and creates
a file named combined.pdf.  Any additions (GUI or more flexibility over output
name or ability to retain input file's bookmarks, or a UNIX port) are welcome.  
Feel free to request changes, but no guarantees will be made.

Tested under Windows.  Requires [PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org/) and [Jython](http://www.jython.org/>)
